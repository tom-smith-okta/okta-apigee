# JWT Verification - token generated by Okta

This API proxy validates a JWT that was created and signed by Okta.

This proxy will work on the Apigee Edge public cloud release.

## Apigee

* This is an Okta-specific version of the more comprehensive Apigee repo created [here](https://github.com/DinoChiesa/ApigeeEdge-JWT-Demonstration). You are encouraged to explore the more comprehensive Apigee repo for more context.

* There is also an excellent accompanying video overview of how Apigee handles jwts [here](https://community.apigee.com/articles/49280/jwt-policies-in-apigee-edge.html).

## Deploying

Several notes:

* Before you deploy the proxy you need to create a cache on the Apigee environment. The cache should be named 'cache1'.

* To deploy the proxy to your Apigee tenant:
  * zip the "apiproxy" directory into an archive (apiproxy.zip).
  * in your Apigee tenant, go to "API Proxies" and click the +Proxy button
  * select "Proxy bundle" then click Next
  * upload the proxy archive .zip file
  * choose a name for the proxy or just keep the default, click Next
  * click Build
  * your proxy will load.
  * click the link to view the proxy in the API editor
  * click the "develop" tab to view the flows and source XML
  * open the Verify-JWT-1 policy
    * update the Issuer value with your authorization server URL

![authorization server](https://s3.amazonaws.com/tom-smith-okta-api-center/authz_server.png "Authorization server")

  * you are now deployed!

## Testing

Your API proxy tenant should now be deployed at {{your Apigee env}}/solar-system

There are three built-in proxy endpoints that you can test against. All of these endpoints will expect a valid access token minted by your authorization server. The access token must be included in the header of the request.

* {{your Apigee env}}/solar-system/test
  * if the access token is valid, this endpoint will return a 200 status OK
* {{your Apigee env}}/solar-system/planets
  * if the access token is valid AND includes the scope "http://myapp.com/scp/silver", this proxy endpoint will pass on the request to the target endpoint, which will return a list of planets.
* {{your Apigee env}}/solar-system/moons
  * if the access token is valid AND includes the scope "http://myapp.com/scp/gold", this proxy endpoint will pass on the request to the target endpoint, which will return a list of moons.

The logic behind this scheme is in the main proxy flow: parse + validate a JWT obtained from Okta.

You can adjust the values here to suit your own use-case.

## Invoking

To generate tokens from Okta, you will need an [Okta tenant](https://developer.okta.com/), and you will need to [configure an authorization server](https://developer.okta.com/authentication-guide/implementing-authentication/set-up-authz-server) on that tenant.

This validation uses the Okta keys obtained from [the well-known public endpoint](https://partnerpoc.oktapreview.com/oauth2/ausce8ii5wBzd0zvQ0h7/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server) for your Okta tenant.

To actually obtain a JWT generated by Okta, you need create an OIDC client in your Okta tenant and then sign in against that OIDC client. Read about creating an OIDC client [here](https://help.okta.com/en/prev/Content/Topics/Apps/Apps_App_Integration_Wizard.htm).

## Commentary

The JWT Verification policy in Apigee Edge is smart enough to extract keys from a JWK set. The authorization server on your Okta tenant [exposes a JWK set](https://partnerpoc.oktapreview.com/oauth2/ausce8ii5wBzd0zvQ0h7/v1/keys). This endpoint provides the public keys that correspond to the private keys used by Okta to sign JWT.  Each public key is identified by a "key ID", aka "kid". The content available at this endpoint changes as Okta rotates keys, but a typical response looks like this:

```json
{
  "keys":
  [
    {
      "alg":"RS256",
      "e":"AQAB",
      "n":"gRynnM4G-MEzCIh6RXZSderUazMYtgTAfGALStft-K8uA0HuszH0eg3p9lqSyiYP3dXRKXBRZkcvKri_xpkXBihwnXJ24O493gnalCWQ08rsguRclcuG9EHyIPJ1lm93ZWNtImSkwDCZu1ikC6epfVODO6LOBbXRyHNMJrue7Bl2vYoLZeQTw0L5TyEofnIKEjS2-Gk07SqLDe3NlWnWHN88A9fKaZEVsmGkAo9QTyfwtOEZt6ROE0VpNwmyii5CDWFDpGDAzWWFghPD3t_hkANGMX709s3JLMeXZjTSXzaYcDECWwErvMWLx-BUvEbZvOfuFgwl32hVyYpM6aQSsQ",
      "kid":"h4U09qoCKSwyI-G7zustzn68X2eMt8QdV3sU6USTfrk",
      "kty":"RSA",
      "use":"sig"
    },
    {
      "alg":"RS256",
      "e":"AQAB",
      "n":"iLzthtqV18UL1kRNEfAJE_CizNGKnINIPOXqHZ0y1kNOzBkgnaNsqkYj4xkzmITfSqcFdnt-bJQVFzXXsoAsgoa7DLtuYVWSmunMxk806wikqFYD7kwmg1nQHh4pSFsIOtEciGs3ZY7r9dxkR1uN6J68eDscKQc-EM7kiPrXb_ByM_fYYgFUeBhc5ftv4ZEZfUAQrPNnEgI66ZyyUqSLnIJLajDwzypIU4mfVFXioYTzWMvxlnVssu1_Mb6aIob8eXEDFT_XxIRiP869KLporKDPARhFxXNEpgpRNVJ5CzjiIDeIigeIYhzbSDmBjgLjSYm00P25PKuvuYof8Pfs4w",

      "kty":"RSA",
      "use":"sig"
    }
  ]
}
```

The API Proxy uses a ServiceCallout to perform a GET on that URL, and then caches the result for one hour. Then, verification can be configured like this:

```xml
<VerifyJWT name="Verify-JWT-1">
    <Algorithm>RS256</Algorithm>
    <Source>inbound.jwt</Source>
    <PublicKey>
      <JWKS ref='cached.okta.jwks'/>
    </PublicKey>
    <Issuer>https://partnerpoc.oktapreview.com/oauth2/ausce8ii5wBzd0zvQ0h7</Issuer>
</VerifyJWT>
```

Just update the <Issuer> value with the appropriate url for you Okta tenant and authorization server ID.

## Thanks

Thanks to Joe B at Okta for some key tips in getting this flow up and running.
